CodeCraft was born out of a simple yet impactful realisation â€“ debugging is a crucial part of coding, and mastering it is a continuous challenge. In the daily grind, we noticed many developers turning to external resources for help, often missing the opportunity to enhance their debugging skills.
So, we built CodeCraft as a solution to make debugging not just educational but fun. With 1:1 solve games, users can compete in a friendly race to debug code and run test cases. This unique approach transforms debugging from a solitary task into an enjoyable and collaborative game.

Our platform also includes daily progress graphs and challenges, keeping users motivated and engaged in their coding journey. Friend battles add a social aspect, turning learning into a shared experience. Premium plans offer advanced features, ensuring sustainability and growth.
CodeCraft is our way of fostering a community where developers can turn the often challenging task of debugging into a source of joy and friendly competition. Thank you for your time, and we're excited to present how CodeCraft is changing the way developers approach debugging.
